# SteamSimulationProject
2D simulation game programmed in C# and Unity

I thought of a great idea for a fun project and possible Steam game.
Before creating a Unity project I decided to map out my logic and program it from scratch in standard C# (Standard Program.cs).
This allowed me stay organized, not get ahead of myself and make sure I understood how to create each mechanic and system. 
I then got to creating the core gameloop within Unity, writing each script based on my standard program.
Unity allows me to easily create a user interface and graphics as my standard program was using console logs to display employee stats.
